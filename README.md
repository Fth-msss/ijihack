# ijihack
 hacking minigame from iji for unity ui

this was made in two hours

you are the yellow square and trying to go to the red square at the end of the maze
touching blue squares or running out of time fails the minigame

puzzles are random every time you restart the puzzle


original minigame has puzzle sizes from 4x5 to 10x5 
this one can go up to 10x10(there was a good reason original is only nx5)
